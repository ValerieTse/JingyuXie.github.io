Hey! This is Jingyu Xie, please feel free to call me Valerie.<br>
I am a Bioinformatics Engineer at WeGene, with a M.Sc. in Epidemiology and Biostatistics from the JC School of Public Health and Primary Care of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and I obtained my B.Sc. in Applied Statistics (Biostatistics) at the School of Public Health of Southern Medical University.<br>
My research interests include Statistical Genetics, Genetic Epidemiology, Population Genetics, Large-scale Multi-Omics data, Machine Learning and Precision Medicine.<br>
Currently, I am focusing on epigenomics, especially the DNA Methylation, in an attempt to understand the (epi)genetic basis of Aging, Metablolism, and Psychiatric diseases.
